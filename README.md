# Loan Default Risk Based on Customer Behavior Using Random Forest Classifier andÂ SMOTE
This is my project (with my team) to finish Data Science Intensive Bootcamp by Rakamin Academy. My team and I worked on a project to predict Loan Default Risk using Random Forest Classifier.

As a data scientist team, we did:
- pre-process data
- create machine learning model 
- analyze the factors that influence the problem
- create business recommendations to the company

I also write about this project in Medium ...
